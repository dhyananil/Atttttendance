# Atttttendance

A simple, fast, and lightweight web app to calculate your attendance percentage and find out how many classes you can afford to miss or need to attend.

**Live site:** https://atttttendance.vercel.app

## How it Works

Enter:

1. Total classes held
2. Classes attended
3. Required attendance percentage

Click **Calculate** to see:

- How many classes you can miss, or
- How many you must attend to reach the required percentage

## Note

This is my first-ever web development project.  
It started as a learning exercise and evolved into a polished tool with a clean, minimal UI.

- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Focused on simplicity and performance
- Designed to be lightweight and responsive
